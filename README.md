# Audio DSP with the usage of Reinforcement learning


## TODO
1. Needs to setup the network to handle audio input. Using Kapre?
2. Implement reward function for the step function
3. Implement the step function
4. Write down the functions that could be applied to DSP and map them to the continous actions of the agent.
